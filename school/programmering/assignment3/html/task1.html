               -Task 2: In order to read from an csv file, i will use a function that takes an event as a parameter. This parameter would be an event. 
               Then i will use the event.target to get the element uploaded. (I will use an input type file i HTML to upload the file. The function that
               reads the file will be triggered on input onchange). The function will then return the element that triggered the event. (the file inputted).
               Further the funtion will create a new object (FileReader). FileReader reads a file and stores it in a variable.
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                -Task 3: At this time, before i have started 2D arrays is the way i want to store the data from the file. The rows representing the different
                trancactions, and each column in the array containing the different types of information assosiated with each trancactions. For this purpose
                i will create a function that takes the string from task2, and splits it so that each index in the array contains all of the information from each of the
                different trancactions. I will store this array in a variable. Then, to get a 2D array i wil take the existing array and split it, so that each
                of the different information-types becomes a different index in a new array. This can then be illustrated as a table. The final 2D array will also be 
                stored in a variable in order to perform the other tasks. The reason i am going with this solution is because i think it is the best way to comprehend
                how the data is stored. 
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                Task 4: In this task i plan to run a function at button onclick, which calculates all of the nessesasy global statistics. I will either have one function
                for each of the of the global statistics or combine some of them in functions as i se appropriate. Each of them will take the values i plan to return
                as parameters as for example max and avg. I am not sure at this point how i am going to calcualate each of the statistics, but the functions should 
                at least loop over the array in order to access the column that consist of the data needed to calculate the different subtasks. 

            </p>

            <p class="info">
                Task 5: In this task i plan to run a single funtion at file-upload which is going to display the data in the file. I plan to loop over the existing array of data
                from task 3. For each of the array indexes i will create both a table row, and columns and fill them with the needed data. The function will most likely take
                the 2D array as a parameter. I plan to use "document.createElement()" and "appendChild combined with nested loops to generate the table.
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                Task 6: This task will also be generated by a function, the function will at least take the array as a paramterer so that the function /table can be
                genereated with different files, and therefor arrays. The table will be generated with different values for each row, representing the different
                statistics for all types and locations, and for distinctly for locations and types. I plan for the function to do the same as the function in task 5;
