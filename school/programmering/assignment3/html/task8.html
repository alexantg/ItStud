                In order to present the statistics in a dynamic way, i dont think it would be necessary to change the way i store data. I would proceed
                the same way i did before with the file-reading process aswell. Instead of the statistics-table, the user would get an input field instead. 
                Then i would loop over the array, checking if the input value matches either of the cells. This would be acheived with nested loops. If the user
                inputs for example "oslo". I would loop the array and collect all the amounts for the value inputed. 
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                I believe this can be achieved somewhat simmilar to the way i solved it before. I would push every amount that matches the input value into a 
                new array, and use the existing functions to calculate the statistics. (the functions that calculates if the array is one-dimensional). These functions
                will then return the total, max, min and average value for the array the function is provided. In this case, this will be the array of amounts 
                that belongs to the inputted value. 
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                I would also need to change the way i present the results. The HTML-table needs to be fully dynamic because it is supposed to be displaying different
                things every time. I would have one table that shows all of the transactions (for example for Oslo), then i would have a second table that displays the 
                proper statistics. I dont think it would be necessary to store the statistics in an array this time, i would rather run each calculating-function with the
                wanted array as an argument, and print the result. 
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                The part of the advanced planning i am more uncertain of, is how to display transactions for a given time-period. I believe i would somehow loop over
                the array and start pushing amounts into a new array at the start-point of and stops when it reaches the end point. The problem with this approach is 
                that the time-stamps in the data file have structure, and it would be difficult to sepereate them into different time-periods.
