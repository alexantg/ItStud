            The finished program opearates close to what i imagined when i started, but it was nessesary to do some changes to the script. Task 2 and 3
            turned out to be the i planned it to be. This is probalby because we have spent some time with this method og reading and storing file data in 
            lectures. When it comes to task 4, it turned out to be different from what i had in mind. I planned to run the calculating functions at a button onclick
            but that turned out to be inefficient, because there where alot of functions that did the different calculations. I ended up with a "main" function 
            that handles all of the HTML-printing and function- calls.

            </p>

            <p class="info">
            In my original plan i also said that the fucntions used to calculate the statistics sholud take the stat it where to calculate as a parameter, but
            this is of course a little bit off, and i ended up giving the functions the array, and a number, representing which
            column the data is on, parameters instead. This way i can calculate the same thing with a different set of data. To access the specific
            column i am looping over the 2D array, and pushing each element into a new array, in this way i can do calculations on this one-dimensional array
            instead. 
            </p>

            <p class="info">
            It is also worth mentioning that i had to define a new set of functions that where used when i calculated the stats for each of the different
            locations and transaction types. This is because, in order to do calculations i chose to push each amount for "Oslo" each amount "Halden" etc into
            a new, one-dimensional array. The initial functions does the calculations based on that the array is multidimensional, so these could not be used.
            </p>

            <p class="info">
            Task 5 and 6 turned out somewhere what i imagined. I did not know how to fill each cell with data, and decided to use arrays. I stored all the variables
            that hold the total amounts in one array, and similar with the rest of the statistics. I got into a serious amount of trouble when i was trying to create each
            of the columns. I wanted an empty cell in the top- left corner, so that the table would look presentable. Therefor i added an empty spot in the first array 
            i was to print. This made the first array one element larger than rest of the arrays. This caused me to always get an undefined column at the end. 
            After alot of questioning, i didnt seem to find a way around it. So i decided to print the first row in the html-file, this way i could get it to work.
            </p>

            <p class="info">
            I also would have hoped my answer to the bonus tasks where more dynamical, and would have worked on different data-files. The way i have solved it now
            the bonus-calculations will only work with this data file. The statistics table will also just work for this data file, because of the bonus tasks. 
            Other than this, the program operates how i planned it to.
