        <h1>Modulo operator</h1>

        <p>The modulo operator have several different use cases in Javascript. First of all does the modulo 
           operator return the rest of a division. If we take the numbers 5 and 2 as an example. 5/2=2.5. 2.5 is not an integer. 
           When we use the modulo operator we can get the rest of the division which is 1.If we type 5%2 Javascript will return 1. 
           Determiting wheter a number is even or odd can sometimes be usefull for other things, other than just if the number
           is even or odd aswelll. This can for example be if you loop through something, and you want a specific thing to happen
           every 10th time you can use modulo to determine which of the indexes occure every 10th time.
