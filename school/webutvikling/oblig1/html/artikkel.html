            <p>And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Yoo. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

                Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Ahh. Alright,
                 let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind 
                 resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
                
                Working. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly 
                into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into 
                the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance 
                the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Huh? Erased from existence.
                
                Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious reprocautions on future events. Do you understand? Are those my clocks I hear? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. 
                Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the
                clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. 
                You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.
